WCF Cell Phone Assignment

Notes:

I have data structures holding the "Detail" and "Header" data gathered from the two .csv files.  

Remaining is to implement a way to distinguish between years in the CellPhoneUsageByMonth.csv file.  I interpreted the instructions to mean you could pass in a year to determine which year the report would show.  There are probably a few other small improvements that could be made - the purchase date comes to mind.

Also remaining is the transformation from the data structures to printable document.  I'll be honest, I've never had to print directly from Java before.
